# Event Planner

This is a single page app to help you keep track of upcoming events. It also features a check the weather function to help you choose the outfit you'll be wearing at your events! 

This app was test driven using my own custom testing framework : https://github.com/AlinaGoaga/JS_testing_framework

## Supported features

- create new events with content, date and time (please note that you not create events in the past)
- see a list of all of the upcoming events in chronological order
- check the weather either by typing in the city that you are interested in or asking the browser to get your location and check the weather at that specific location 
- the events will persist on the page even after refreshing
- events occuring in the past will be hidden from the user however they can still be found in the browser's local storage if there's a need to review them

## How to use the app

- clone the repository and cd into the project
- run open index.html in the terminal 

## Running the tests

- run open SpecRunner.html in the terminal
- once the file opens in the browswer, hit inspect and use the console to see the tests
